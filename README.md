# Mohammed's Web Portfolio

**Live Demo:** [https://mohammed054.github.io/portfolio/](https://mohammed054.github.io/portfolio/)

Hi! I’m **Mohammed**, a passionate web developer on a journey to master the art of building for the web. What started as a curiosity for how websites work has turned into a dedicated pursuit of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I love experimenting with code, breaking things to see how they work, and putting them back together better than before. My goal is to create web experiences that are not just functional, but **fun, interactive, and user-friendly**.
